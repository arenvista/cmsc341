      <div>
        <p>
          A research team collects and analyzes DNA samples from live 
organisms in a wide forest of amazon. You are assigned the task of 
developing a database application which is adapted to the project’s 
specific requirements. The main operations in this application are 
insert, find, and remove. Since the efficiency of operations is 
extremely important, we have decided to use a hash table to manage 
accessing the samples information. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The DNA molecules have four chemical building blocks which can
 appear in different orders or different sequences. The sequence of 
these building blocks tells scientists the kind of genetic information 
that is carried in a particular DNA segment. For example, the sequence 
can highlight changes in a gene that may cause a disease. The building 
blocks are called Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine 
(T). The notation to present the sequences uses the characters A, C, G, 
and T. The sequence AACAGGGTCA presents a sample sequence.

          In this application the keys are sequences, we know that this 
can cause collisions and clustering in a hash table. To manage the 
collision cases, we use multiple forms of probing for the collision 
handling policy. The number of samples in the database can change during
 different stages of the project. When a change is required, we need to 
rehash the entire table. However, the rehash operation happens 
incrementally during multiple regular operations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="my-accordion">Hash Tables</h2>
      <div>
        <p>A hash table is a data structure which implements the map 
ADT. It stores the pairs of key-value. The key determines the index 
number of an array cell (bucket) in which the value will be stored. A 
hash function calculates the index number. If there is more than one 
value for a key in the data set, the hash table uses a collision 
handling scheme to find another cell for storing the new value.</p>
        <h4>Linear Probing</h4>
        <p>When we try to find an index in the hash table for a key and 
we find out that the determined bucket is taken, we need to find another
 bucket to store the key.
          In a linear probing we store the information in the next 
available bucket. In this scheme the jump step to find the next 
available bucket is one.</p>
        <h4>Quadratic Probing</h4>
            <p> Linear probing can cause clustering, i.e. having many data points in a row. Clustering reduces the search efficiency.
            Using quadratic probing the jump step to find the next available bucket is the square of iteration number.
            </p>
        <h4>Double-Hash Probing</h4>
            <p>In this project we use the following equation to find the
 next bucket for the purpose of the double hashing collision handling, 
in which i = 0,1,2,3 ....
            <br><br>  <b><i>index = ((Hash(key) % TableSize) + i x (11-(Hash(key) % 11))) % TableSize</i></b>
            </p>
      </div>
      
      <h2 class="my-accordion">Assignment</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Your assignment is to complete the class DnaDb and write the appropriate test functions.</p>
        <p>The application starts with a hash table of size MINPRIME. 
After certain criteria appearing it will switch to another table and it 
transfers all data nodes from the current table to the new one 
incrementally. Once the switching process starts it scans 25% of the 
table and transfers any live nodes it finds in the old table and at 
every consecutive operation (insert/remove) It continues to scan 25% 
more of the table and transfers live data from the old table to the new 
table until all data is transferred. We do not transfer deleted buckets 
to the new table.</p>
        <p>After an insertion, if the load factor becomes greater than 
0.5, we need to rehash to a new hash table. The capacity of the new 
table would be the smallest prime number greater than 4 times the 
current number of data points. The current number of data points is 
total number of occupied buckets minus total number of deleted buckets.</p>
        <p>After a deletion, if the number of deleted buckets is more 
than 80 percent of the total number of occupied buckets, we need to 
rehash to a new table. The capacity of the new table would be the 
smallest prime number greater than 4 times the current number of data 
points. The current number of data points is total number of occupied 
buckets minus total number of deleted buckets.</p>
        <p>During a rehashing process the deleted buckets will be 
removed from the system permanently. They will not be transferred to the
 new table.</p>
        <p>If a change of collision handling policy is requested by the 
user while the program is running, the new policy will be applied to the
 new table when a new rehash is triggered.</p>

        <h4>DnaDb Class</h4>
        <p>The DnaDb class uses the DNA class. It has a member variable 
to store a pointer to a hash function. It also has two member variables 
to store pointers to two arrays of DNA objects. These arrays are 
m_currentTable and m_oldTable, and the m_sequence member variable of the
 DNA object is used as the key for hashing purposes. 
          A DNA object has another member variable which stores an ID 
for the location in which the sample has been found. The location ID and
 the sample sequence define the uniqueness  of a DNA object together.</p>
        <p>
          </p><div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">DnaDb::DnaDb(int size, hash_fn hash, prob_t probing = DEFPOLCY)</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              The constructor takes size to specify the length of the 
current hash table, and hash is a function pointer to a hash function. 
The type of hash is defined in <tt>DnaDb.h</tt>.
              <br>The table size must be a prime number between MINPRIME
 and MAXPRIME. If the user passes a size less than MINPRIME, the 
capacity must be set to MINPRIME. If the user passes a size larger than 
MAXPRIME, the capacity must be set to MAXPRIME. If the user passes a 
non-prime number the capacity must be set to the smallest prime number 
greater than user's value.
              The probing parameter specifies the type of collision 
handling policy for the current hash table.
              <br>Moreover, the constructor creates memory for the current table and initializes all member variables.

            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function inserts an object into the current hash 
table. The insertion index is determined by applying the hash function 
m_hash that is set in the DnaDb constructor and then reducing the output
 of the hash function modulo the table size. A sample hash function is 
provided in the <tt>driver.cpp</tt> file.
              <br>Hash collisions should be resolved using the probing 
policy specified in the m_currProbing variable. We insert into the table
 indicated by m_currentTable. After every insertion we need to check for
 the proper criteria, and if it is required, we need to rehash the 
entire table incrementally into a new table. The incremental rehashing 
proceeds with scanning 25% of the table at a time and transfer any live 
data found to the new table. Once we transferred the live nodes in the 
first 25% of the table, the second 25% live data will be transferred at 
the next operation (insertion or removal). Once all data is transferred 
to the new table, the old table will be removed, and its memory will be 
deallocated.
              <br>If the DNA object is inserted, the function returns 
true, otherwise it returns false. A DNA object can only be inserted 
once. The hash table does not contain duplicate objects. Moreover, the 
location ID value should be a valid one falling in the range 
[MINLOCID-MAXLOCID].
              Every DNA object is a unique object carrying the DNA's 
sequence and the location ID. The DNA's sequence is the key which is 
used for hashing.

            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function removes a data point from either the current
 hash table or the old hash table where the object is stored. In a hash 
table we do not empty the bucket, we only tag it as deleted. To tag a 
removed bucket we can use the member variable m_used in the DNA class. 
To find the bucket of the object we should use the proper probing policy
 for the table.
              <br>After every deletion we need to check for the proper 
criteria, and if it is required, we need to rehash the entire table 
incrementally into the current table. The incremental rehashing proceeds
 with scanning 25% of the table at a time and transfer any live data 
found to the new table. Once we transferred the live nodes in the first 
25% of the table, the second 25% live data will be transferred at the 
next operation (insertion or removal). Once all data is transferred to 
the new table, the old table will be removed, and its memory will be 
deallocated. 
              <br>If the DNA object is found and is deleted, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.

              This function returns the load factor of the current hash 
table. The load factor is the ratio of occupied buckets to the table 
capacity.
              An occupied bucket is a bucket which can contain either a 
live data node (available to be used) or a deleted node.

      <div><p>
        </p><ul>
            <li>
              Private helper functions may be added to the DnaDb class; 
however, they must be declared in the private section of the class 
declaration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every table may have its own collision handling policy. If
 previously a change of policy has been requested and then a rehash 
initiates the new table will use the new policy and the old table will 
use its own policy while it exists.
            </li>
            <li>
              The allocated memory to the hash table must be dynamically managed at execution time when there is rehashing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the current hash table exceeds some criteria the 
DnaDb class rehashes the data into a new hash table. This requires 
creating a new table and swapping the two tables, so the newly created 
table becomes the current table.
            </li>
            <li>
              The capacity of the new table is determined by the 
information from the current table (which will become the old table). It
 would be the smallest prime number greater than ((m_currentSize - 
m_numDeleted)*4).
            </li>
            <li>
              For rehashing we scan 25% of the table at every operation 
and transfer any live data to the new table. The class DnaDb has a 
member variable named m_transferIndex which can be used to keep track of
 the current status of transfer.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 25% of data is an integer number, we use the floor value of the result.
            </li>
            <li>
              When rehashing, the deleted buckets will be removed from the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              The insertion of data points always happens in the current table.
            </li>
            <li>
              The find operation can happen in the current table and the old table if it exists.
            </li>
            <li>
              The remove operation can happen in the current table and the old table if it exists.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the incremental rehashing ends and there are no more 
live data objects in the old table, the old table must be removed and 
its memory must be deallocated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Here are the rules for lazy deletion,
              <ul>
                <li>Treat deleted element as empty when inserting.</li>
                <li>Treat deleted element as occupied when searching.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Here are the rules for rehashing criteria,
              <ul>
                <li>rehash once the load factor exceeds 50%.</li>
                <li>rehash once the deleted ratio exceeds 80%.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The load factor is the number of occupied buckets divided 
by the table size. The number of occupied buckets is the total of 
available data and deleted data.
            </li>
            <li>
              The deleted ratio is the number of deleted buckets divided by the number of occupied buckets.
            </li>
            <li>
              No STL containers or additional libraries may be used in the DnaDb class. STL containers can be used in <tt>mytest.cpp</tt> for testing purposes.
            </li>

      <h2 class="my-accordion">Testing</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
            <li>The test file name must be <tt>mytest.cpp</tt>; the file name must be in lower case, a file name like <tt>myTest.cpp</tt> is not acceptable. </li>
            <li>The test file must contain the declaration and implementation of your <tt>Tester</tt> class and the <tt>main()</tt> function as well as all your test cases, i.e. calls to your test functions.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for adequately testing your work 
before submission. The following section presents a non-exhaustive list 
of tests to perform on your implementation.</li>
            <li>You must write a separate function for every test case.</li>
            <li>Every test function must return true/false depending on 
passing or failing the test. Visual outputs are not accepted as test 
results.</li>
            <li>The dump() function should not be called in the test functions. The dump() function is only provided to facilitate debugging.</li>
            <li>Tests cannot be interactive. The test file <tt>mytest.cpp</tt> must compile and run to completion. </li>
            <li>An example of declaring, implementing, and calling a test function, and outputting the test results was provided in the <tt>driver.cpp</tt> file of project 0.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://swe.umbc.edu/~donyaee/res/testing.html">testing guidelines</a> page provides information that helps you to write more effective test cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Testing incrementally makes finding bugs easier.
 Once you finish a function and it is testable, make sure it is working 
correctly.</p>
    <h4>Testing DnaDb Class</h4>
    <p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>Test the insertion operation in the hash table. The 
following presents a sample algorithm to test the normal insertion 
operation:
          <ul>
            <li>There are some non-colliding data points in the hash table.</li>
            <li>Insert multiple non-colliding keys.</li>
            <li>Check whether they are inserted in the correct bucket (correct index).</li>
            <li>Check whether the data size changes correctly.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Test the find operation (getDNA(...) function) for an error case, the DNA object does not exist in the database.</li>
        <li>Test the find operation (getDNA(...) function) with several non-colliding keys. </li>
        <li>Test the find operation (getDNA(...) function) with several 
colliding keys without triggering a rehash. This also tests whether the 
insertion works correctly with colliding data.</li>
        <li>Test the remove operation with a few non-colliding keys.</li>
        <li>Test the remove operation with a number of colliding keys without triggering a rehash.</li>
        <li>Test the rehashing is triggered after a descent number of data insertion.</li>
        <li>Test the rehash completion after triggering rehash due to 
load factor, i.e. all live data is transferred to the new table and the 
old table is removed.</li>
        <li>Test the rehashing is triggered after a descent number of data removal.</li>
        <li>Test the rehash completion after triggering rehash due to 
delete ratio, i.e. all live data is transferred to the new table and the
 old table is removed.</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Random Numbers for Testing</h4>
    <p>For testing purposes, we need data. Data can be written as fixed 
values or can be generated randomly. Writing fixed data values might be a
 tedious work since we need a large amount of data points. You must use 
the provided Random class to generate test data.</p>
      <p>In the file <tt>driver.cpp</tt> there is the class Random which
 generates pseudorandom numbers. The class is using a default seed 
value. It also is possible to change the seed value. On the same machine
 it always generates the same sequence of numbers. That is why the 
numbers are called pseudorandom numbers, they are not real random 
numbers. Please note, the numbers are machine dependent, therefore, the 
numbers you see in the sample file <tt>driver.txt</tt> might be different from the numbers your machine generates.</p>
    <h4>Testing For Memory Leaks / Memory Errors</h4>
        <p>
          </p><ul>
            <li>Run your test program in valgrind; check that there are no memory leaks or errors. 
              <br><b>Note:</b> If valgrind finds memory errors, compile 
your code with the -g option to enable debugging support and then re-run
 valgrind with the -s and --track-origins=yes options. valgrind will 
show you the line numbers where the errors are detected and can usually 
tell you which line is causing the error.</li>
              <li>Never ignore warnings. They are a major source of errors in a program.</li>
          </ul>
        <p></p>
