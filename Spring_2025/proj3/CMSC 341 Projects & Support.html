      <h2 class="my-accordion">Introduction</h2> 
      <div>
        <p>
          There is a very large number of messages posted on social 
media every day. The apps need to present the messages to the users in 
an organized way. Different social media apps take different strategies 
for presenting messages. A design team decided to test multiple 
algorithms for prioritizing the messages to be presented to a user. Your
 job is to implement a priority queue ADT for organizing the posts based
 on multiple priority algorithms. The design provides multiple 
implementations of a priority queue ADT such as different types of heap 
data structure. The type of heap can change at any time.
        </p><p>
          The application automatically prioritizes the posts. The 
prioritization is based on some specific criteria. The algorithm that 
uses the criteria to calculate the priorities can change. Therefore, the
 application should have the possibility of changing the post 
priorities. An algorithm that can determine the priority will be 
implemented in a function. Such an architecture allows us to use 
different priority functions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="my-accordion">Heap</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>Skew Heap</h4>
        <p>
          A skew heap is a specialized version of a heap data structure which performs 
          the insertion and deletion operations in O(log n) amortized time. This data 
          structure is a binary tree in which the root always holds the node with the 
          highest priority. Skew heap uses merge operation to perform insertion and 
          deletion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major operations supported by a skew heap are insertion of
 elements, reading the highest priority element, and removing the 
highest priority element. Reading the highest priority element is just a
 matter of reading the root node of the heap. The other two operations, 
insertion and removal, are applications of the merge function:
          </p><ul>
            <li>To insert a new node x into an existing skew heap H, we treat x as a single-node skew heap and merge it with H.</li>
            <li>To remove the node with highest priority value, we delete the root node and then merge the root's left and right sub-heaps.</li>
          </ul>
          We see, then, that the merge function is key to all of the 
major skew heap operations. If we can implement merge correctly, 
insertion and removal are simple.
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The special feature of a skew heap is the merge operation 
which combines two skew heaps into a single, valid skew heap. Let p1 and
 p2 be positions in two skew heaps (e.g. pointers to nodes). The merge 
operation is defined recursively:
          </p><ul>
            <li>If p1 is Null, return p2; similarly, if p2 is Null, return p1.</li>
            <li>Assume that p1 has higher priority than p2; if not, swap, p1 and p2.</li>
            <li>Swap the left and right subtrees of p1.</li>
            <li>Recursively merge p2 and the left subtree of p1, replacing the left subtree of p1 with the result of the recursive merge.</li>
          </ul>
          The following figure shows two min-skew heaps and the result 
of merging the two. In a min-heap a smaller priority number means a 
higher priority node.

          <img class="center-large" src="CMSC%20341%20Projects%20&amp;%20Support_files/merge12.png">
        <p></p>
        <h4>Leftist Heap</h4>
        <p>A leftist heap is similar to skew heap and it uses a merge 
operation for insertion and deletion. However, it maintains a specific 
property and it uses the property during the merge operations.
          Every node in a leftist heap stores a value called Null Path 
Length (NPL). This value presents the lowest number of edges from the 
node to a null node. In the other word the NPL value represents the 
shortest possible path from a node to a null node.
        </p>
        <p>During a merge operation if the NPL value of the right child 
is larger than the NPL value of the left child we swap the children. 
This generally makes the left subtree heavier than the right subtree.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="my-accordion">Assignment</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          In this project, you will implement a priority queue class 
based on a skew-heap or a Leftist-heap data structure; it can maintain a
 min-heap or a max-heap based on the computed priority for every node, 
where the priority function is provided to the queue constructor via a 
function pointer. Inserting to and extracting from the skew/leftist heap
 uses a heap merge function which guarantees that the heap property 
(min-heap or max-heap) is maintained; the comparisons that are part of 
the merge process will be made on the computed priorities for the 
objects in the heap. The queue class allows for the priority function to
 be changed; in which case the heap must be rebuilt.
          Moreover, the data structure can switch between a skew heap or
 a leftist heap at the request of the class user. Such a request will 
trigger reconstruction of the heap.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, you are provided with the following files:
          </p><ul>
            <li><a href="https://swe.umbc.edu/~donyaee/current/projects/proj3files/squeue.h">squeue.h</a> – The interface for the Post, and SQueue classes.</li>

          </ul>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      
      <h2 class="my-accordion">Specifications</h2>
      <div>
        <p>There are two classes in this project. The class SQueue has a member variable of type Post.</p>
        <h4>Class Post</h4>
        <p>The implementation of this class is provided to you. You are 
not allowed to modify the class. This class stores the following 
information about a post:
          </p><ul>
            <li>m_postID stores a unique ID for every post.</li>
            <li>m_likes stores the number likes for the post. </li>
            <li>m_connectLevel stores a number presenting the distance 
between the poster and the user who will see the post. The value 1 
indicates that the poster and the viewer are directly connected. The 
value 2 indicates that there is third person between the poster and the 
viewer. There can be up to 5 connection levels.</li>
            <li>m_postTime stores the time that a message was posted. 
This variable can take a value between 1 and 50. It indicates the 
placement of post. Using this value we can see what message was posted 
earlier comparing to other messages. For example, the value 50 indicates
 that the message was the last one posted. </li>
            <li>m_interestLevel stores the level that a post may be in 
the interest of the viewer. The value of 1 presents the least and the 
value of 10 presents the most.</li>
          </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Priority Functions</h4>
        <p>
          A priority function is a user defined function that can use 
the information in the class Post to determine a priority value for a 
post. Two example functions are provided in the driver.cpp file. You can
 define your own priority functions. In fact, different plants may have 
different criteria for this purpose. The ability of using different 
functions allows us to adapt to different priority algorithms. The heap 
can accept a prioritization function. This is accomplished by passing a 
function pointer to the constructor. The function pointer is the address
 of a function that will be used to compute the priority for posts. The 
function must take an Post object as input and must return an integer 
priority value. A typedef for the function pointer is provided for you 
in the header file:
          </p><pre class="code">  typedef int (*prifn_t)(const Post&amp;);</pre>
          This says that prifn_t is a pointer to a function that takes a Post&amp; argument.
        <p></p>
        <p>
          </p><div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">int priorityFn1(const Post &amp; post);</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function determines a priority value for the argument
 and returns the priority value.
              The algorithm in this function uses the information in the
 Post class. In this algorithm a greater value means a higher priority. 
To use this function we need to build a max-heap.
              If the function cannot calculate a valid priority value it
 returns zero.
              <br><b>Note:</b> The implementation of this function is provided to you. You do not need to modify it.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">int priorityFn2(const Post &amp; post);</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function returns the priority value for the argument 
and returns the priority value.
              The algorithm in this function uses the information in the
 Post class. In this algorithm a smaller value means a higher priority. 
To use this function we need to build a min-heap.
              If the function cannot calculate a valid priority value it
 returns zero.
              <br><b>Note:</b> The implementation of this function is provided to you. You do not need to modify it.
            </div>
          </div>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Overloaded Insertion Function</h4>
        <p>
          There is an overloaded insertion function for the class Post 
          to help you debugging the project. The implementation is provided to you. You do not need to modify the function.
        </p>
        <h4>Class SQueue</h4>
        <p>
          The class SQueue constructs a skew or a leftist data structure
 of the type min-heap or max-heap. This class has a member variable 
called m_heap. The member variable m_heap presents the root node of the 
heap data structure and it is of the type Post. The following table 
presents the list of member functions that need implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          </p><div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">SQueue(prifn_t priFn, HEAPTYPE heapType, STRUCTURE structure);</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This is the constructor. It must be provided with a 
pointer to the prioritization function, the type of heap, and the 
desired data structure.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">SQueue::~SQueue()</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              The destructor deallocates the memory and re-initializes the member variables.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">SQueue::SQueue(const SQueue&amp; rhs)</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              The copy constructor must make a deep copy of the rhs 
object. It must function correctly if rhs is empty. This function 
creates an exact same copy of rhs.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">SQueue&amp; SQueue::operator=(const SQueue&amp; rhs)</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              The assignment operator creates an exact same copy of rhs.
 You should not call the copy constructor in the implementation of the 
assignment operator.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">bool SQueue::insertPost(const Post&amp; input)</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              Inserts a Post object into the queue. It must maintain the
 min-heap or the max-heap property depending on the settings. Moreover, 
if the selected data structure is leftist heap, it needs to maintain a 
correct value of Null Path Length (NPL) in the node.
              If the Post object does not provide a valid priority value
 the object is not inserted and the function returns false, otherwise 
the function returns true. 
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">Post SQueue::getNextPost()</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function extracts (removes the node) and returns the 
highest priority post from the queue. It must maintain the min-heap or 
max-heap property. The function throws an out_of_range exception if the 
queue is empty when the function is called.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">void SQueue::mergeWithQueue(SQueue&amp; rhs)</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function merges the host queue with the rhs; it 
leaves rhs empty; it transfers all nodes from rhs to the current heap. 
Two heaps can 
              only be merged if they have the same priority function and
 they are of the same data structure. If the user 
              attempts to merge queues with different priority 
functions, or two different data structures a 
              domain_error exception should be thrown.
              This function requires protection against self-merging. 
Merging a heap with itself is not allowed.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">void SQueue::clear()</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function clears the queue. It must delete all the 
nodes in the heap, leaving the heap empty. Moreover, it re-initializes 
the member variables.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">int SQueue::numPosts() const</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              It returns the current number of posts in the queue.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">void SQueue::printPostQueue() const</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              It prints the contents of the queue using preorder 
traversal. Although the first post printed should have the highest 
priority, the remaining posts will not necessarily be in priority order.
              Please refer to the sample output file (<a href="https://swe.umbc.edu/~donyaee/current/projects/proj3files/driver.txt">driver.txt</a>) for the format of this function's output.

              This function sets a new priority function and its 
corresponding heap type (min-heap or max-heap). It must rebuild the 
heap! To rebuild the heap this application does not re-allocate memory 
to the objects; it reuses the current memory.
              <br>Note: it is the responsibility of the user to pass 
compatible arguments priFn and heapType. The class implementation does 
not need to check the compatibility.

            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">void SQueue::setStructure(STRUCTURE structure)</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function sets the data structure, i.e. it is either 
SKEW or LEFTIST. It must rebuild a heap with the new structure using the
 nodes in the current data structure.
              <br>Note: rebuild means transferring nodes from the 
current data structure to the new data structure. Rebuild operation does
 not re-create the nodes.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey;font-weight: bold;">void SQueue::dump()</div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="border: 1px solid grey; padding-left:2em;">
              This function prints out the nodes information in an 
in-order traversal. For every node, it prints the priority followed by 
the post's ID; and in the case of a leftist heap the output is followed 
by the value of NPL for the node. 
              The <a href="https://swe.umbc.edu/~donyaee/res/tree_viewer.html">tree viewer tool</a>
 shows a graphical representation of the output of the dump function. 
You can copy and paste the dump() output in the viewer. This tool 
facilitates debugging.

      <h2 class="my-accordion">Additional Requirements</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Private helper functions must be declared in the header file. No other modifications to the header file are permitted!</li>
          <li>No STL containers or additional libraries may be used in 
the implementation of the project classes. However, you can use STL 
containers in the Tester class for the testing purposes.</li>
          <li>The required functionality is provided in the Post class. 
There is no need for any modifications to the implementation of this 
class.</li>
          <li>The test program must use the provided Random class to generate test data.</li>
          <li>Your code should not have any memory leaks or memory errors.</li>
          <li>In the case of a leftist heap the lowest level of nodes which store the keys have zero NPL value.</li>
          <li>Computed priority values may not be pre-computed and 
stored with the Post object in the queue. They must be computed as 
needed using the priority function.</li>
          <li>Insertion to and extraction from the heap must run in amortized logarithmic time.</li>
          <li>Follow all coding standards as described on the C++ Coding
 Standards. In particular, indentations and meaningful comments are 
important.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="my-accordion">Testing</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>The test file name must be <tt>mytest.cpp</tt>; the file name must be in lower case, a file name like <tt>myTest.cpp</tt> is not acceptable. </li>
          <li>The test file must contain the declaration and implementation of your <tt>Tester</tt> class and the <tt>main()</tt> function as well as all your test cases, i.e. calls to your test functions.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for thoroughly testing your work 
before submission. The following section presents a non-exhaustive list 
of tests to perform on your implementation.</li>
          <li>You must write a separate function for every test case.</li>
          <li>Every test function must return true/false depending on 
passing or failing the test. Visual outputs are not accepted as test 
results.</li>
          <li>Tests cannot be interactive. The test file <tt>mytest.cpp</tt> must compile and run to completion. </li>
          <li>An example of declaring, implementing, and calling a test function, and outputting the test results was provided in the <tt>driver.cpp</tt> file of project 0.</li>
          <li>The <a href="https://swe.umbc.edu/~donyaee/res/testing.html">testing guidelines</a> page provides information that helps you to write more effective test cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Testing incrementally makes finding bugs easier.
 Once you finish a function and it is testable, make sure it is working 
correctly.</p>
        <h4>Testing SQueue class</h4>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The majority of tests need to check whether the heap property is satisfied after the operations.
        You might want to implement a helper function in your Tester class that performs such a functionality. 
        Then, this helper can be called in multiple test functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          </p><ul>
            <li>Test insertion for a normal case of min-heap. After a 
decent number of insertion (e.g. 300 nodes) we traverse the tree and 
check that the heap property is satisfied at every node.</li>
            <li>Test insertion for a normal case of max-heap. After a 
decent number of insertion (e.g. 300 nodes) we traverse the tree and 
check that the heap property is satisfied at every node.</li>
            <li>Test removal for a normal case of min-heap. After a 
decent number of insertion (e.g. 300 nodes) we check whether all 
removals happen in the correct order.</li>
            <li>Test removal for a normal case of max-heap. After a 
decent number of insertion (e.g. 300 nodes) we check whether all 
removals happen in the correct order.</li>
            <li>Test all nodes in a leftist heap have the correct NPL value.</li>
            <li>Test a leftist heap preserves the property of such a 
heap, i.e. at every node the NPL value of the left child is greater than
 or equal to the NPL value of the right child.</li>
            <li>Test whether after changing the priority function a 
correct heap is rebuilt with the same data (nodes) and the different 
priority function.</li>
            <li>Test merge of an empty queue (an edge case) with a 
normal queue. This is a call to the function 
SQueue::mergeWithQueue(SQueue&amp; rhs) where rhs is a normally 
populated queue.</li>
            <li>Test the SQueue class copy constructor for a normal case.</li>
            <li>Test the SQueue class copy constructor for an edge case.</li>
            <li>Test the SQueue class assignment operator for a normal case.</li>
            <li>Test the SQueue class assignment operator for an edge case.</li>
            <li>Test that attempting to dequeue an empty queue throws an out_of_range exception.</li>
            <li>Test that attempting to merge queues with different priority functions throws a domain_error exception.</li>
          </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Random Numbers for Testing</h4>
        <p>For testing purposes, we need data. Data can be written as 
fixed values or can be generated randomly. Writing fixed data values 
might be a tedious work since we need a large amount of data points. You
 must use the provided Random class to generate test data.</p>
        <p>In the file <tt>driver.cpp</tt> there is the class Random 
which generates pseudorandom numbers. The class is using a default seed 
value. On the same machine it always generates the same sequence of 
numbers. That is why the numbers are called pseudorandom numbers, they 
are not real random numbers. Please note, the numbers are machine 
dependent, therefore, the numbers you see in the sample file <tt>driver.txt</tt> might be different from the numbers your machine generates.</p>
        <h4>Memory leaks and errors</h4>
        <p>
          </p><ul>
            <li>Run your test program in valgrind; check that there are no memory leaks or errors. 
              <br><b>Note:</b> If valgrind finds memory errors, compile 
your code with the -g option to enable debugging support and then re-run
 valgrind with the -s and --track-origins=yes options. valgrind will 
show you the lines numbers where the errors are detected and can usually
 tell you which line is causing the error.</li>
              <li>Never ignore warnings. They are a major source of errors in a program.</li>
          </ul>
        <p></p>
